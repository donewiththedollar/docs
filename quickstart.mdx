## Common First-Timer Questions

<Accordion title="How long before I see profits?">
  It depends on market conditions. In active markets, you might see fills within hours. In quiet markets, it might take longer.

  **Don't expect:** Instant profits
  **Do expect:** Activity within 24 hours in normal conditions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my position goes negative?">
  This is normal! The strategy is designed to average into positions and recover.

  - Small losses are expected
  - The system has recovery mechanisms
  - Auto-hedging provides protection (if enabled)
  - Only panic at 10%+ losses
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I watch it constantly?">
  **First week:** Check daily to understand behavior
  **After learning:** Weekly checks are usually fine
  **Exception:** Highly volatile markets - check more often
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I stop the bot?">
  Consider stopping when:
  - You want to take profits
  - Market conditions are extreme
  - You don't understand what's happening
  - You're approaching loss limits

  Don't stop just because of small fluctuations - that's normal!
</Accordion>
