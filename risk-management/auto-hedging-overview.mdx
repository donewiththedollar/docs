# Auto-Hedging: Godmode HFT Grid

The **Auto-Hedge** feature transforms the Vortex DCA strategy into a "godmode" high-frequency trading grid by **replacing the liquidation safeguard with intelligent auto-hedging**. Instead of stopping grid placement when approaching liquidation, it automatically hedges positions to protect against liquidation while keeping the grid active.

---

## 🎯 What is Auto-Hedging?

Auto-hedging is an advanced risk management system that:

- **Monitors** your NET position continuously (long qty - short qty)
- **Triggers** automatic hedge orders when drawdown or liquidation thresholds are hit
- **Places** opposite-side market orders to protect your position
- **Keeps** your grid trading active during volatile moves
- **Recovers** with trailing profit targets on hedge positions

<Info>Auto-hedging works on BloFin, Bybit, and other exchanges that support hedge mode (simultaneous long/short positions).</Info>

## 🔄 Traditional vs Auto-Hedge

### Traditional Liquidation Safeguard

```
Price drops → Approaching liquidation → STOP grid orders
❌ No new positions
❌ Exposure remains
❌ Manual intervention required
❌ Grid disabled until recovery
```

### Auto-Hedge Approach

```
Price drops → Approaching liquidation → HEDGE position automatically
✅ Grid continues operating
✅ Risk neutralized
✅ Automatic recovery
✅ Profit from hedge closure
```

## ⚡ Key Benefits

### 1. **Uninterrupted Grid Operation**
Your grid keeps placing orders even during extreme volatility, maximizing profit potential.

### 2. **Active Risk Protection**
Instead of passive monitoring, auto-hedge actively protects your position by opening opposite trades.

### 3. **Automatic Recovery**
Hedge positions close automatically with small profits (0.2% default) as price recovers.

### 4. **Anti-Cascade Protection**
Advanced safety mechanisms prevent repeated hedging of the same drawdown event.

### 5. **Trailing Stop Profit Lock**
Hedge positions use trailing stops to lock in profits during favorable moves.

- **Leverage**: 5x-20x recommended for beginners, up to 50x for advanced users

### Not Suitable For

- ❌ Very low volatility assets (hedge triggers may be too frequent)
- ❌ Extremely small accounts (less than $500)
