# Risk Management Best Practices

Successful algorithmic trading requires more than just good strategies—it demands **disciplined risk management**. This guide covers essential best practices for protecting your capital while maximizing long-term profitability.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Never Risk More Than You Can Afford to Lose

<Warning>Only trade with capital you can afford to lose completely. Never use rent money, emergency funds, or borrowed capital for trading.</Warning>

**Recommended Allocation:**
- **Beginner:** 1-5% of investment portfolio
- **Intermediate:** 5-15% of investment portfolio
- **Advanced:** 15-30% of investment portfolio

### 2. Position Sizing is Everything

**The 1% Rule:**
No single symbol should represent more than 1-2% risk to your total trading capital.

```
Total Capital: $10,000
Max Risk per Symbol: $100-200 (1-2%)

If using 20x leverage:
Position size: $100 * 20 = $2,000 notional
Wallet exposure per symbol: 20% max
```

### 3. Diversification Reduces Risk

**Don't Put All Eggs in One Basket:**
- Trade 5-10 different symbols
- Mix volatility levels (BTC + altcoins)
- Use different strategies (Vortex DCA + XGrid)
- Spread across exchanges (if possible)

### 4. Leverage Amplifies Both Gains AND Losses

**Leverage Guidelines:**

| Experience | Max Leverage | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Beginner | 5x-10x | Learn with safety margin |
| Intermediate | 10x-20x | Balance of profit and risk |
| Advanced | 20x-50x | High efficiency, requires skill |
| Expert | 50x+ | Extreme risk, tiny margin for error |

<Tip>Start with lower leverage (5x-10x) even if you're experienced. You can always increase it later.</Tip>

## 📊 Position Management

### Total Exposure Limits

**Golden Rule:** Never exceed 80% total wallet exposure across all positions.

```json
{
  "symbols": ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT", "SOLUSDT", "DOGEUSDT"],
  "wallet_exposure": 0.15  // 15% per symbol = 60% total
}
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Balance: $10,000
Symbols: 4
Exposure per symbol: 15%

Max position value per symbol: $10,000 * 0.15 = $1,500
Total exposure: $1,500 * 4 = $6,000 (60%)
Reserve: $4,000 (40%) ✅ Safe
```

### Reserve Capital

**Always maintain reserves:**
- **20% minimum:** For averaging down
- **30% recommended:** For opportunities and safety
- **40% conservative:** Maximum safety buffer

**Why Reserves Matter:**
```
Scenario WITHOUT reserve:
100% deployed → Price drops 10%
→ No capital to average down
→ Forced to wait or take loss

Scenario WITH 40% reserve:
60% deployed → Price drops 10%
→ Use 20% reserve to average down
→ Improve entry price, faster recovery
```

## 🛡️ Auto-Hedge Best Practices

### When to Enable Auto-Hedge

**✅ Enable Auto-Hedge When:**
- Using high wallet exposure (greater than 50%)
- Trading volatile assets (DOGE, meme coins)
- Running aggressive HFT grids
- Want maximum grid uptime
- Have experience with the platform

**❌ Keep Auto-Hedge Disabled When:**
- Starting out (use liquidation safeguard first)
- Using low wallet exposure (less than 30%)
- Trading stable assets with low volatility
- Prefer simpler, conservative approach

### Configuration Safety Tiers

**Tier 1: Conservative (Recommended for Beginners)**
```json
{
  "wallet_exposure": 0.15,
  "leverage": 10,
  "vortex_autohedge_enabled": true,
  "vortex_autohedge_ratio": 0.7,
  "vortex_autohedge_on_drawdown_pct": 0.03,
  "vortex_autohedge_on_liquidation_distance_pct": 0.15
}
```

**Tier 2: Balanced (Recommended for Intermediate)**
```json
{
  "wallet_exposure": 0.5,
  "leverage": 20,
  "vortex_autohedge_enabled": true,
  "vortex_autohedge_ratio": 0.5,
  "vortex_autohedge_on_drawdown_pct": 0.04,
  "vortex_autohedge_on_liquidation_distance_pct": 0.10
}
```

**Tier 3: Aggressive (Experienced Only)**
```json
{
  "wallet_exposure": 0.8,
  "leverage": 30,
  "vortex_autohedge_enabled": true,
  "vortex_autohedge_ratio": 0.5,
  "vortex_autohedge_on_drawdown_pct": 0.06,
  "vortex_autohedge_on_liquidation_distance_pct": 0.08
}
```

### Testing Auto-Hedge Safely

**Progressive Testing Approach:**

**Day 1-3: Minimal Exposure**
```json
{
  "symbols": ["DOGEUSDT"],
  "wallet_exposure": 0.05,  // 5% only
  "vortex_autohedge_enabled": true
}
```
→ Watch for hedge triggers, verify behavior

**Day 4-7: Small Exposure**
```json
{
  "wallet_exposure": 0.10  // Increase to 10%
}
```
→ Monitor hedge performance, check logs

**Day 8-14: Medium Exposure**
```json
{
  "symbols": ["DOGEUSDT", "BTCUSDT"],
  "wallet_exposure": 0.15  // 30% total
}
```
→ Evaluate profitability, adjust parameters

**Day 15+: Full Deployment**
```json
{
  "symbols": ["DOGEUSDT", "BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT"],
  "wallet_exposure": 0.2  // 60% total
}
```
→ Monitor closely, optimize settings

## ⚖️ Leverage Management

### The Leverage-Risk Trade-off

**Lower Leverage (5x-10x):**
```
Pros:
✅ Wider liquidation distance
✅ More room for drawdowns
✅ Better for choppy markets
✅ Lower stress

Cons:
❌ Lower capital efficiency
❌ Slower profit accumulation
❌ More capital tied up
```

**Higher Leverage (20x-50x):**
```
Pros:
✅ Higher capital efficiency
✅ Faster profit potential
✅ Less capital per position
✅ More trading opportunities

Cons:
❌ Tighter liquidation distance
❌ Less margin for error
❌ Higher stress
❌ Requires constant monitoring
```

### Optimal Leverage by Strategy

**Geometric Long Only:**
```json
{
  "strategy": "geometric_long_only",
  "leverage": 10  // Conservative leverage
}
```
Reason: DCA strategy needs room for averaging down

**Vortex DCA (No Auto-Hedge):**
```json
{
  "strategy": "vortex_dca",
  "leverage": 15
}
```
Reason: Multi-grid approach needs moderate leverage

**Vortex DCA (With Auto-Hedge):**
```json
{
  "strategy": "vortex_dca",
  "vortex_autohedge_enabled": true,
  "leverage": 25
}
```
Reason: Auto-hedge protects, allows higher leverage

**XGrid HFT:**
```json
{
  "strategy": "xgrid",
  "leverage": 30
}
```
Reason: Tight grids, quick exits, aggressive scalping

---

## 📉 Drawdown Management

### Understanding Drawdown

**Drawdown** = Peak-to-trough decline in account value

```
Account Peak:   $10,000
Current Value:  $9,200
Drawdown:       $800 (8%)
```

### Acceptable Drawdown Limits

| Risk Tolerance | Max Drawdown | Action Plan |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Conservative | 10-15% | Stop trading, reassess |
| Moderate | 15-25% | Reduce exposure 50% |
| Aggressive | 25-35% | Reduce exposure 25% |
| Very Aggressive | 35-50% | Continue with caution |

### Recovery from Drawdowns

**The Math of Recovery:**
```
10% loss requires 11.1% gain to recover
20% loss requires 25% gain to recover
30% loss requires 42.8% gain to recover
50% loss requires 100% gain to recover
```

<Warning>Deep drawdowns become exponentially harder to recover from. Cut losses early!</Warning>

### Virtual Chunking for Recovery

Enable virtual chunking to systematically recover from underwater positions:

```json
{
  "virtual_chunking_enabled": true,
  "chunking_threshold": 0.03,  // Activate at -3% unrealized loss
  "chunk_size": 0.25,  // Split into 4 chunks
  "attack_order_multiplier": 3.0  // 3x size for averaging down
}
```

**How It Works:**
```
Position: -$300 (3% loss) → Virtual chunking activates
Split into 4 chunks:
  Chunk 1: -$75 → Place 3x attack order
  TP at 0.1% → Profit $7.50, chunk closed
  Chunk 2: -$75 → Repeat
  ...
Total position gradually recovered
```

---

## 🚨 Stop-Loss Strategy

### Mental Stop-Loss Levels

**Per-Symbol Stop:**
```
Max loss per symbol: 2-5% of account
Example: $10,000 account
  Stop per symbol: $200-500
```

**Total Portfolio Stop:**
```
Max total drawdown: 20-30%
Example: $10,000 account
  Stop all trading: $7,000-8,000
```

### Implementing Stops

**Option 1: Manual Monitoring**
```
Check positions daily
If symbol down greater than 5%: Close position
If total down greater than 20%: Stop all bots
```

**Option 2: Automated (Liquidation Safeguard)**
```json
{
  "liquidation_safeguard_enabled": true,
  "liquidation_threshold_pct": 0.15  // Stop if liq within 15%
}
```

**Option 3: Auto-Hedge (Preferred)**
```json
{
  "vortex_autohedge_enabled": true,
  "vortex_autohedge_on_drawdown_pct": 0.04  // Hedge at 4% loss
}
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Over-Leveraging

**❌ Wrong:**
```json
{
  "leverage": 100,
  "wallet_exposure": 1.0,
  "symbols": ["DOGEUSDT"]
}
```
→ 100x leverage + 100% exposure = Almost guaranteed liquidation

**✅ Right:**
```json
{
  "leverage": 20,
  "wallet_exposure": 0.15,
  "symbols": ["DOGEUSDT", "BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT"]
}
```
→ Moderate leverage + diversified = Sustainable

---

### 2. Ignoring Exchange Fees

**Impact of Fees:**
```
Grid Strategy: 100 trades/day
Exchange Fee: 0.05% per trade
Daily Fee: 100 * 0.05% = 5% of volume

Monthly: 150% of volume in fees!
```

**Mitigation:**
- Use maker orders when possible (rebates)
- Choose exchanges with low fees
- Factor fees into TP targets
- Consider VIP tier upgrades

---

### 3. No Position Limits

**❌ Wrong:**
Letting positions grow indefinitely

**✅ Right:**
```json
{
  "max_position_size": 50000,  // USDT
  "max_orders_per_side": 10
}
```

---

### 4. Emotional Trading

**Avoid:**
- Panic closing profitable bots
- Increasing leverage after losses
- Adding more symbols during drawdowns
- Changing configs constantly

**Do Instead:**
- Trust your system
- Stick to your plan
- Make changes gradually
- Keep emotions in check

---

### 5. Poor Record Keeping

**❌ Wrong:**
No tracking, no analysis

**✅ Right:**
- Save logs weekly
- Export trade history monthly
- Maintain spreadsheet of results
- Document configuration changes

---

## 🌟 Advanced Risk Techniques

### Kelly Criterion (Position Sizing)

**Formula:**
```
Kelly % = (Win Rate * Avg Win - Loss Rate * Avg Loss) / Avg Win

Example:
Win Rate: 60%
Avg Win: 1%
Loss Rate: 40%
Avg Loss: 0.8%

Kelly % = (0.6 * 1 - 0.4 * 0.8) / 1 = 0.28 (28%)
```

Use 25-50% of Kelly result for safety:
```
Kelly: 28%
Conservative Kelly: 28% * 0.25 = 7% per position
```

### Correlation-Based Diversification

**Avoid Correlated Positions:**
```
❌ Bad Diversification:
  DOGEUSDT
  SHIBUSDT
  PEPEUSDT
→ All meme coins, highly correlated

✅ Good Diversification:
  BTCUSDT (store of value)
  ETHUSDT (smart contract platform)
  SOLUSDT (high-performance L1)
  DOGEUSDT (meme coin)
→ Different sectors, lower correlation
```

### Dynamic Position Sizing

Adjust exposure based on performance:

```python
if monthly_return > 10%:
    # Winning → Increase exposure slightly
    wallet_exposure *= 1.1  # +10%

elif monthly_return < -10%:
    # Losing → Decrease exposure
    wallet_exposure *= 0.8  # -20%
```
