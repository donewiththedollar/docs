## Connection Issues

### "API Key Invalid" or "Authentication Failed"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Incorrect API key or secret
  - Extra spaces in copied credentials
  - API key expired or deleted
  - Wrong account (main vs sub-account)

  **Solutions:**
  1. Re-copy credentials from exchange (no extra spaces)
  2. Verify key exists and is active on exchange
  3. Check you're using the correct account
  4. For WEEX: Verify passphrase is exactly correct (case-sensitive)
  5. Create new API key if issues persist
</Accordion>

### "Connection Timeout" or "Network Error"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Exchange API temporarily down
  - Internet connectivity issues
  - IP restriction on API key

  **Solutions:**
  1. Check exchange status page
  2. Wait a few minutes and retry
  3. Verify IP whitelist includes your server
  4. Try from a different network
</Accordion>

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Too many API requests per second
  - Running too many bots simultaneously
  - Grid refresh too frequent

  **Solutions:**
  1. Reduce number of active bots
  2. Increase `grid_refresh_interval` (e.g., 120 → 180 seconds)
  3. Reduce `geometric_max_levels` (fewer orders)
  4. Stagger bot start times
</Accordion>

## Bot Won't Start

### "Insufficient Balance"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Funds in Spot wallet instead of Futures
  - Existing positions using all margin
  - Wallet exposure exceeds available balance

  **Solutions:**
  1. Transfer funds: Spot → Futures wallet
  2. Check available balance (not total balance)
  3. Reduce `wallet_exposure` setting
  4. Close some existing positions
</Accordion>

### "Symbol Not Found"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Typo in symbol name
  - Symbol not available on selected exchange
  - Symbol delisted or trading paused

  **Solutions:**
  1. Verify exact symbol format (e.g., `BTCUSDT` not `BTC/USDT`)
  2. Check symbol exists on your exchange
  3. Try a different, known-good symbol
</Accordion>

### "Position Mode Mismatch"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Exchange in Hedge Mode but bot expects One-Way
  - Vice versa

  **Solutions:**
  1. Check exchange position mode setting
  2. BloFin/Bybit: Can change in exchange settings
  3. Match bot configuration to exchange mode
</Accordion>

---

## Orders Not Placing

### "Order Size Too Small"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - `quote_size_usdt` below exchange minimum
  - Calculated order size rounds to zero

  **Solutions:**
  1. Increase `quote_size_usdt` (minimum $5-10 for most exchanges)
  2. Check exchange minimum order size for symbol
  3. Increase `wallet_exposure` for larger orders
</Accordion>

### "Orders Immediately Cancelled"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Grid refresh repositioning orders
  - Orders placed outside valid price range
  - Post-only orders crossing spread

  **Solutions:**
  1. Increase `refresh_threshold` (less frequent updates)
  2. Check `outer_distance` isn't too extreme
  3. Verify spread is wide enough for maker orders
</Accordion>

### "No Orders Placed"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Spread too tight for profitable trading
  - Loss management tier blocking new entries
  - Price outside `no_entry_above`/`no_entry_below` limits

  **Solutions:**
  1. Check `min_profitable_spread_bps` vs actual spread
  2. Check loss management state in logs
  3. Verify price limits aren't blocking entry
  4. Wait for better market conditions
</Accordion>

## Position Issues

### "Position Keeps Growing Without TP"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Strong trend against your position
  - TP target too aggressive
  - Fees eating into profit

  **Solutions:**
  1. Enable auto-hedging for protection
  2. Lower `minimum_tp` target
  3. Reduce `qty_multiplier` for slower averaging
  4. Enable virtual chunking for recovery
  5. Consider manual intervention in strong trends
</Accordion>

### "Position Stuck Underwater"

  3. Check loss management tier (may be in defend mode)
  4. Wait for market to recover
  5. Consider partial manual close to reduce exposure
</Accordion>

### "Unexpected Liquidation"

<Accordion title="Causes and Solutions">
  **Causes:**
  - Leverage too high
  - Wallet exposure too high
  - Auto-hedge didn't trigger in time
  - Flash crash / extreme volatility

  **Prevention:**
  1. Use lower leverage (10-20x for beginners)
  2. Keep wallet exposure under 30%
  3. Enable liquidation safeguard
  4. Set `emergency_liq_close_bps` to close before liq
  5. Enable auto-hedging with early trigger
