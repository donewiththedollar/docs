## Vortex DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)

<Card title="Best For" icon="chart-line">
  Accumulating positions during downtrends or volatile markets
</Card>

### How It Works

Vortex DCA places multiple buy orders at different price levels, creating a "grid" that catches price dips. As price falls, the bot accumulates more at better prices, lowering your average entry.

```
Current Price: $100
         │
    $99  ├── BUY ORDER (small)
    $98  ├── BUY ORDER (medium)
    $97  ├── BUY ORDER (larger)
    $96  ├── BUY ORDER (largest)
         │
    Average Entry: Better than $100!
```

### Key Features
- **Geometric Grid Spacing**: Orders spread wider as price moves further from entry
- **Auto-Rebalancing**: Grid refreshes every 2-3 minutes to follow price
- **Position Recovery**: Virtual chunking system rescues underwater positions
- **Auto-Hedging**: Optional hedging when drawdown exceeds threshold

## Perpetual Market Maker

<Card title="Best For" icon="scale-balanced">
  Earning spread in sideways/ranging markets
</Card>

### How It Works

The Perp Market Maker acts like a professional market maker, placing both buy AND sell orders around the current price. You profit from the "spread" - the difference between bid and ask prices.

```
         ASK $100.05 ← SELL ORDER
              │
    SPREAD ───┼─── You earn this!
              │
         BID $99.95  ← BUY ORDER
```

### Key Features
- **Two-Sided Quoting**: Profits from any price movement
- **Whale Detection**: Places orders near large support/resistance walls
- **Loss Management Tiers**: Automatic risk reduction when losing
- **50+ Advanced Signals**: Trap detection, cascade hunting, velocity tracking

### Risk Warning
<Warning>
Market making is complex. This strategy has 100+ configurable parameters.
Start with a preset and small position sizes until you understand the behavior.
</Warning>

## XGrid (Momentum Scalping)

<Card title="Best For" icon="bolt">
  Capturing momentum moves in volatile markets
</Card>

### How It Works

XGrid uses technical analysis (EMA crossovers, Donchian channels) to detect trend direction, then scalps with the trend for quick profits.

```
EMA 11 crosses ABOVE EMA 23?
         │
    YES ─┴─ LONG SIGNAL
         │
         ▼
    Place BUY orders
    Quick TP at 0.3-0.5%
```

### Key Features
- **Trend Detection**: EMA 11/23 crossover with Donchian confirmation
- **Fast Execution**: 30-second signal caching for quick entries
- **Volatility Filter**: NATR ensures sufficient movement for profits
- **Peak/Trough Confirmation**: Validates signals before entry
