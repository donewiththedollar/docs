    - **Exchange**: Any
    - **Best for**: Learning the platform
    - **Wallet exposure**: 5%
    - **Take profit**: 0.5%
  </Card>
  <Card title="Geometric Long Only">
    - **Risk**: Medium
    - **Exchange**: Any
    - **Best for**: Bull market DCA
    - **Wallet exposure**: 100%
    - **Take profit**: 0.3-0.5%
  </Card>

### 2. Perp Market Maker Presets (Intermediate+)

**What is Perp MM?** A two-sided strategy that quotes buy AND sell orders, profiting from the spread between them.

#### BloFin v7 Long Short Counterscalp (Recommended for BloFin)

<ParamField path="Risk Level" type="string">
  Aggressive
</ParamField>

**Plain English:** This preset makes money by placing orders on both sides of the market. When you get stuck in a losing position, it automatically opens trades in the opposite direction to offset losses while waiting for recovery.

**Key Features:**
| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **equity_pct: 5%** | Sizes your grid based on 5% of account. As you profit, positions grow automatically. |
| **75x leverage** | High capital efficiency. A 1% move = 75% position change. |
| **XGrid Counter Scalp** | When stuck long and price dropping, opens shorts to scalp profits. |
| **Reactive Spacing** | Widens spreads automatically when orderbook gets thin or volatile. |
| **24h Force Exit** | Won't let positions age forever - forces exit after 24 hours. |
| **10% Hard Stop** | Emergency exit if losses hit 10% of position. |

**Who should use this:**
- Traders comfortable with leverage
- Those who can check the bot at least once daily
- Accounts with $500+ capital

---

#### Bybit v7 Long Short Counterscalp

Same as BloFin v7 but tuned for Bybit's fee structure and leverage limits.

**Differences from BloFin:**
- 50x max leverage (vs 75x on BloFin)
- Slightly wider base spread (accounts for different liquidity)
- Same risk management features

---

#### HFT v6 Long Short MM

<ParamField path="Risk Level" type="string">
  Very Aggressive
</ParamField>

**Plain English:** High-frequency version with faster quote refresh and tighter spreads. More trades, smaller profits per trade.

**Key Features:**
- $10 quote size (vs $7 on v7)
- 2-second refresh cycle
- Geometric sizing (50 levels)
- No equity-based scaling

**Who should use this:**
- Experienced traders only
- High-volume symbols (DOGE, BTC, ETH)
- Those comfortable with high trade frequency

---

### 3. Auto-Hedge Presets

**What is Auto-Hedge?** Automatically opens opposite positions when your main position is losing, protecting against large drawdowns.

#### 2026 Vortex Auto-Hedge Multi

<ParamField path="Risk Level" type="string">
  Moderate
</ParamField>

**Plain English:** Runs Vortex DCA on multiple symbols. When any position draws down 10% OR gets close to liquidation, the bot automatically hedges to limit losses.

**Default Setup:**
- Symbols: DOGE + 1000PEPE
- 40% total wallet exposure (20% each)
- Hedge triggers at 10% drawdown
- Also hedges when liquidation price gets close

**Who should use this:**
- Traders wanting automated risk management
- Those trading multiple symbols
- Medium to large accounts ($2000+)

## Understanding Key Settings

### equity_pct (v7 presets)

This controls how your position sizes scale with your account.

```
Account: $1,000
equity_pct: 5%

Grid uses: $1,000 × 5% = $50 per cycle

After profits, account: $1,200
Grid uses: $1,200 × 5% = $60 per cycle
```

**Higher = more aggressive growth, more risk.**

---

### xgrid_counter_scalp

When enabled, if your main position is underwater:

```
Main position: LONG 100 ASTER, -5% loss
XGrid detects: Downtrend continuing

Counter position opened: SHORT 50 ASTER
→ Scalps quick profits while main recovers
→ Offsets some of the main position's losses
```

---

### time_decay / force_exit

Prevents positions from aging forever:

| Setting | Typical Value | What Happens |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| breakeven_after | 48 hours | Tries to exit at breakeven |
| exit_loss_after | 48 hours | Accepts small loss to exit |
| force_exit_after | 24 hours | Market order exit regardless |

---
