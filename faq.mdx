  PUMPKIN trades on Sui DEXs:

  1. Get a Sui wallet (Sui Wallet, Suiet, etc.)

## Trading & Strategies

<Accordion title="Which strategy should I use?">
  **Quick guide:**

  | Your Situation | Recommended Strategy |
  |---------------|---------------------|
  | Beginner | Vortex DCA (Conservative preset) |
  | Want to accumulate | Vortex DCA |
  | Range-bound market | Perp Market Maker |
  | High volatility | XGrid |
  | $500-1000 capital | Single strategy, 1-2 symbols |
  | $2000+ capital | Multiple strategies/symbols |

  See the [Strategy Overview](/strategies/overview) for detailed comparison.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What returns can I expect?">
  **Honest answer:** Returns vary significantly based on market conditions, strategy, and settings.

  - Market making in good conditions: 0.1-0.5% daily
  - DCA in trending markets: Depends on entry/exit timing
  - Bad conditions can result in losses

  **Important:**
  - Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
  - Start small to understand behavior
  - Never risk more than you can afford to lose
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I run multiple bots?">
  **Yes!** You can run multiple bots simultaneously:

  - Different symbols on the same exchange
  - Same symbol on different exchanges (arbitrage)
  - Different strategies for diversification

  **Recommendation:** Start with one bot, add more as you learn.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if my bot is working?">
  Check these indicators:

  1. **Status**: Green = running, Red = error
  2. **Orders**: Should see open orders in dashboard
  3. **Logs**: Trading console shows activity
  4. **Positions**: Track open positions and P&L

  If orders appear and fill, the bot is working correctly.
</Accordion>

## Risk & Safety

<Accordion title="Can I lose money?">
  **Yes, trading involves risk.**

  Possible loss scenarios:
  - Market moves strongly against your position
  - Liquidation if using high leverage
  - Extended drawdown before recovery
  - Black swan events (exchange hacks, flash crashes)

  **Mitigation:**
  - Start with conservative presets
  - Use auto-hedging for protection
  - Never risk more than you can afford to lose
  - Diversify across symbols/strategies
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my bot goes offline?">
  If the bot disconnects:
  - Existing positions remain open
  - Open orders stay on exchange
  - No new orders placed until reconnect
  - Positions may not be managed (risk!)

  **Protection:**
  - Set stop losses on exchange manually
  - Use auto-hedging for large positions
  - Monitor positions even when bot is off
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does loss management work?">
  The bot uses tiered loss management:

  | Loss Level | Action |
  |------------|--------|
  | 0-1% | Normal trading |
  | 1-3% | Widen spreads, reduce size |
  | 3-6% | Stop new entries, defend only |
  | 6%+ | Exit priority mode |
  | 10% | Hard stop - close all |

  See [Risk Management](/risk-management/risk-management-best-practices) for details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is liquidation and how do I avoid it?">
  **Liquidation** = Exchange forcibly closes your position when margin is insufficient.

  **Avoid by:**
  - Using lower leverage (start with 10x or less)
  - Keeping wallet exposure under 30%
  - Enabling auto-hedging
  - Setting hard stop losses
  - Monitoring positions regularly
</Accordion>

## Technical Issues

<Accordion title="Bot won't start - what do I check?">
  Common issues:

  1. **API Keys**: Verify correct and have Trade permission
  2. **Balance**: Ensure funds in correct wallet (Futures, not Spot)
  3. **Symbol**: Check symbol is valid and tradeable
  4. **Exchange**: Verify exchange connection works

  See [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) for detailed solutions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why are my orders being cancelled?">
  Normal behavior:

  - Grid refresh repositions orders as price moves
  - Orders cancel when price moves too far
  - Rate limiting may cancel excess orders

  If excessive:
  - Increase `grid_refresh_interval`
  - Reduce number of grid levels
  - Check exchange rate limits
</Accordion>

  Quant Dash is a web application - no installation needed!

  Requirements:
  - Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
