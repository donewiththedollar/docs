# Scaling Agent

The **Scaling Agent** is an interactive command-line assistant built into the Bot Management tab. It helps you optimize your perp market maker (perp_mm) bot settings through natural conversation and guided commands.

<Info>The Scaling Agent only works with **perp_mm** strategy bots. Vortex DCA and other strategies use different parameters.</Info>

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Accessing the Agent

1. Navigate to **Bot Management** tab
2. Find the **Scaling Agent Console** at the top of the page
3. Type commands or natural language questions
4. Press Enter or click Send

### First Time?

If you don't have a running perp_mm bot, the agent will guide you to:
1. Select an appropriate preset (like "BloFin v7 Long Short Counterscalp")
2. Configure your exchange credentials
3. Start your first bot

## 🎯 Natural Language

You can also just ask questions naturally:

- **"I want more profit"** - Get scaling recommendations
- **"Make my bot safer"** - Conservative settings guide
- **"What's my risk level?"** - Risk analysis
- **"Explain equity_pct"** - Educational content
- **"Need more grid levels"** - Grid configuration help

---

## 📊 /overview Command

See all your running bots across exchanges:

```
/overview
```

**Returns:**
- Active exchanges (Bybit, BloFin, etc.)
- Running bot count
- Total effective exposure across all bots
- Per-bot breakdown with config, strategy, exposure
- Risk warnings if exposure is high

**Example output:**
```
**Bot Overview**

**Active Exchanges:** blofin, bybit
**Running Bots:** 2
**Total Effective Exposure:** 375% of equity

---
**🟢 Running Bots:**

**BLOFIN** - perp_mm
- Config: BloFin v7 Long Short Counterscalp
- Settings: 5% equity × 75x = **375%** exposure
- Symbols: ASTER, SOL, XRP

⚠️ **Moderate Risk Level**
Combined exposure: 375% - This is aggressive but manageable.
```

---

## 📈 /symbols Command

Get real-time symbol recommendations for market making:

```
/symbols          # Uses your bot's exchange
/symbols bybit    # Force Bybit symbols
```

**Returns top 10 symbols ranked by MM Score:**

| Symbol | Price | 1h Vol | Spread | ATRP | Trend | Score |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| ASTER | $0.08 | $2.1M | 0.05% | 0.32 | 🟢 | 8.5 |
| SOL | $185 | $15M | 0.02% | 0.28 | 🟢 | 7.2 |
| XRP | $2.15 | $8M | 0.03% | 0.25 | 🔴 | 6.8 |

**MM Score Formula:**
```
(volume / 100K) × (1 / spread) × min(ATRP × 10, 5) × (leverage / 50)
```

**Best for MM:** High volume, low spread, moderate ATRP (0.1-0.5)

## 🧮 Key Concepts

### equity_pct (The Growth Engine)

Controls what % of your account equity is used for grid sizing:

| equity_pct | $1,000 account | $10,000 account |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 3% | $30 per cycle | $300 per cycle |
| 5% | $50 per cycle | $500 per cycle |
| 10% | $100 per cycle | $1,000 per cycle |

**Why it matters:**
- As your account grows, positions automatically scale up
- Combined with leverage: `equity_pct × leverage = effective exposure`
- At 10% with 75x: effective exposure = 750%

### Effective Exposure Formula

```
Effective Exposure = equity_pct × leverage
```

**Example:**
- 5% equity_pct × 50x leverage = 250% exposure
- A 1% adverse price move costs: 250% × 1% = **2.5% of your account**

### XGrid Counter Scalp

When enabled, automatically opens counter-positions when market moves against you:

1. You're LONG, market dumps 2%
2. XGrid opens a SHORT position (counter-scalp)
3. If market keeps falling, SHORT profits offset LONG losses
4. If market reverses, original LONG profits

**Best for:** Volatile, choppy markets where direction is uncertain

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Config Synchronization

When you modify settings through the Scaling Agent:

1. **JSON file updated** - Bot process reads this on restart
2. **Database updated** - Frontend JSON editor shows new values
3. **Backup created** - Previous config saved with timestamp

<Tip>Changes require a **bot restart** to take effect. The running bot uses the config from when it started.</Tip>

### Safety Features

- **Automatic backups** before any change
- **Validation** prevents invalid configurations
- **Warnings** for dangerous settings
- **Confirmation required** for degen mode

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "No perp_mm configs found"

Your bot isn't using the perp_mm strategy. The Scaling Agent only works with perp_mm bots.

**Solution:** Start a bot with a perp_mm preset like "BloFin v7 Long Short Counterscalp"

### Changes not appearing in JSON editor

SQLAlchemy JSON column detection issue (rare).

**Solution:** Refresh the page after making changes

### Bot not using new settings

Bots read config at startup only.

**Solution:** Restart your bot after making changes
