# Bot Configuration Parameters

Understanding bot configuration parameters is essential for optimizing your trading strategy. This guide covers all parameters for both single-symbol and multi-symbol configurations.

<Info>
  **Multi-symbol configs** give you more control and allow per-symbol customization. Single-symbol configs are simpler but less flexible.
</Info>

## Core Strategy Parameters

### Grid Configuration

<ParamField path="nr_clusters" type="number" default="4">
  **Number of grid clusters** - How many layers of orders to place on each side

  - **Conservative**: 2-3 clusters (fewer, safer positions)
  - **Moderate**: 4 clusters (balanced approach)
  - **Aggressive**: 5+ clusters (more positions, more risk)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="outer_distance" type="number" default="0.04">
  **Outer grid distance** - How far from current price to place the furthest orders (as decimal)

  - `0.03` = 3% from current price
  - `0.04` = 4% from current price (recommended)
  - `0.05` = 5% from current price

  <Tip>Wider grids (0.04-0.05) work better in volatile markets</Tip>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="ratio_power" type="number" default="1.6">
  **Grid distribution power** - Controls how grid orders are spaced

  - `1.0` = Linear spacing (equal distance between orders)
  - `1.2-1.4` = Slight geometric spacing
  - `1.6` = Strong geometric spacing (more orders near price)

  Higher values concentrate more orders near the current price.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="first_level_distance" type="number" default="0.0025">
  **First order distance** - Distance to the first grid order (as decimal)

  - `0.002` = 0.2% from price (tight)
  - `0.0025` = 0.25% from price (recommended)
  - `0.003` = 0.3% from price (wider)
</ParamField>

### Grid Clustering Algorithms

The Vortex DCA strategy supports intelligent grid placement using three different clustering algorithms. Each algorithm determines where to place your grid levels based on different market analysis methods.

<ParamField path="clustering_enabled" type="boolean" default="false">
  **Enable clustering** - Activate intelligent grid placement algorithms

  When disabled, uses traditional geometric grid distribution.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="clustering_algo" type="string" default="LINEAR">
  **Clustering algorithm** - Choose how grid levels are calculated

  Available options:
  - `LINEAR` - Evenly-spaced geometric distribution (default)
  - `PEAKS_TROUGHS_HIGHLOW` - Historical support/resistance levels
  - `KMEANS` - Statistical price clustering zones
</ParamField>

#### LINEAR (Default)

Traditional geometric grid distribution with equal spacing controlled by `ratio_power`.

**Best for:**
- Stable market conditions
- Beginners learning grid trading
- Assets with predictable volatility

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "clustering_enabled": true,
  "clustering_algo": "LINEAR"
}
```

**Characteristics:**
- No historical data required
- Fast computation
- Predictable, symmetric grid placement

---

#### PEAKS_TROUGHS_HIGHLOW

Analyzes historical price data to identify swing highs and lows, placing grid levels at proven support and resistance zones where price historically reversed.

**Best for:**
- Range-bound markets
- Assets with clear support/resistance levels
- Technical analysis-focused trading
- Markets with strong price memory

<ParamField path="clustering_period" type="string" default="1M">
  **Historical lookback period** - How far back to analyze price data

  Options: `1W`, `1M`, `3M`, `6M`, `1Y`

  - `1W-1M` = Responsive to recent market structure (altcoins)
  - `3M-6M` = Balanced, medium-term S/R levels
  - `1Y` = Long-term view (Bitcoin, major assets)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="clustering_timeframe" type="string" default="5m">
  **Candle timeframe** - Resolution of historical data

  Options: `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`

  - `1m-5m` = High precision, large datasets (liquid pairs)
  - `15m-1h` = Balanced precision and performance
  - `4h-1d` = Macro view, lighter data requirements
</ParamField>

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "clustering_enabled": true,
  "clustering_algo": "PEAKS_TROUGHS_HIGHLOW",
  "clustering_period": "3M",
  "clustering_timeframe": "1m",
  "nr_clusters": 4
}
```

<Tip>
  Use `3M` with `1m` timeframe for BTC - captures recent swing points with high precision
</Tip>

---

#### KMEANS

Uses K-Means machine learning algorithm to identify natural price consolidation zones where price historically spent the most time. Grid levels are placed at cluster centroids.

**Best for:**
- Volatile markets with consolidation zones
- Assets that range-trade before breakouts
- Finding hidden liquidity zones
- Statistical/ML-based trading approaches

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "clustering_enabled": true,
  "clustering_algo": "KMEANS",
  "clustering_period": "1W",
  "clustering_timeframe": "5m",
  "nr_clusters": 6
}
```

**How it works:**
1. Collects closing prices from historical period
2. Uses K-Means to cluster prices into `nr_clusters` groups
3. Places grid levels at each cluster centroid
4. Levels naturally concentrate where price consolidated

<Warning>
  K-Means works best with shorter periods (1W-1M) for recent consolidation zones
</Warning>

#### Choosing the Right Algorithm

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="ruler" title="Use LINEAR when">
    - You're new to grid trading
    - Market conditions are stable and predictable
    - You want consistent, geometric grid distribution
    - Historical patterns aren't reliable for the asset
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Use PEAKS_TROUGHS_HIGHLOW when">
    - Asset shows clear support/resistance levels
    - You trust technical analysis
    - Market is range-bound with defined levels
    - You want grids at proven reversal zones
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="brain" title="Use KMEANS when">
    - Asset is highly volatile with consolidation zones
    - You want to find hidden liquidity areas
    - Traditional S/R isn't obvious visually
    - You trust statistical/ML approaches
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  All clustering algorithms respect your `outer_distance` and `ratio_power` settings. Historical data is fetched once per grid refresh (default: 3 minutes). If data fetch fails, automatically falls back to LINEAR.
</Info>

  Use higher exposure for stable coins (BTC, ETH) and lower for altcoins
</Tip>

## Advanced Parameters

<ParamField path="allow_add_smaller" type="boolean" default="false">

  Prevents orders from clustering too tightly
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="desired_distance" type="number" default="0.05">

  Works with `outer_distance` to size the grid
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="no_entry_above" type="number" default="null">
  **No entry above price** - Don't open positions above this price

  Set to limit entries in overextended markets. Example: `50000` for BTC
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="no_entry_below" type="number" default="null">
  **No entry below price** - Don't open positions below this price
