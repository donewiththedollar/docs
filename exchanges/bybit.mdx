Protect your account with 2FA‚Äîthis is **strongly recommended** for security.

1. Go to **Account & Security > Two-Factor Authentication**
2. Download **Google Authenticator** or **Authy** on your phone
3. Scan the QR code and enter the 6-digit code
4. **Save your backup key securely**‚Äîyou'll need it if you lose access to your phone

4. Set the following permissions:
   - ‚úÖ **Read-Write** (for order placement)
   - ‚úÖ **Contract Trading** (for USDT perpetual futures)
   - ‚ùå **Withdrawal** (disable this for security‚Äîbots don't need it)
5. (Optional) Set **IP Restriction** to your server's IP for extra security
6. Click **Submit** and complete 2FA verification

**Copy your API Key and Secret immediately‚ÄîBybit only shows the Secret once!**

<Tip>Store your API credentials in a password manager‚Äîyou'll need them for the bot dashboard.</Tip>

## Step 7: Configure Your Bot Settings

1. Click **Bot Management** in the sidebar
2. Scroll down to **Bot Configurations**
3. Click the **`<>`** (JSON editor) icon to open the config editor
4. Customize your settings:
   - **Symbols**: Choose trading pairs (e.g., `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`)

## Step 8: Deposit Funds into Bybit

1. In Bybit, click **Assets > Deposit**
2. Select **USDT** (or another stablecoin like USDC)

   - **Ethereum (ERC20)**, **Polygon**, **Arbitrum**, etc.
4. Copy the deposit address and send funds from your wallet

<Warning>Always send a small test deposit first (e.g., $10) to verify the address!</Warning>

---

## Step 9: Transfer Funds to USDT Perpetual Account

The bot trades on **USDT Perpetual Futures**, so you need to move funds to that account.

1. Go to **Assets > Transfer**
2. From: **Funding Account** ‚Üí To: **USDT Perpetual**
3. Asset: **USDT**
4. Amount: Enter the amount you want to trade with
5. Click **Confirm Transfer**

---

## Step 10: Set Leverage and Margin Mode

1. Go to **Derivatives > USDT Perpetual**
2. For each symbol you're trading:
   - Click the **leverage icon** (e.g., `10x`)
   - Set your desired leverage (start with **5x-10x** for safety)
   - Change margin mode to **Cross** (recommended for shared margin)

<Tip>Cross margin shares your balance across all positions, reducing liquidation risk.</Tip>

---

## Step 11: Launch and Monitor Your Bot

1. Return to the bot dashboard at **[trade.quantumvoid.org](https://trade.quantumvoid.org)**
2. Click **Start** on your bot configuration
