# How to Start a New Bybit Bot

Welcome to the **Bybit Trading Bot Setup Guide**! This step-by-step walkthrough will help you set up your bot securely and efficiently on Bybit. You'll need a wallet (SUI, Solana, or BASE) with **any amount of PUMPKIN tokens** ready.

---

## Step 1: Sign Up for Bybit

1. Open your browser and go to **[https://partner.bybit.com/b/quantumvoid](https://partner.bybit.com/b/quantumvoid)**
2. Sign up using the referral link **`quantumvoid`** for exclusive benefits
3. Complete email verification
4. Set a strong password and agree to terms of service

<Tip>Using our referral link supports the project and may unlock trading fee discounts!</Tip>

---

## Step 2: Complete KYC Verification (Recommended)

While not always mandatory, KYC increases withdrawal limits and account security.

1. Go to **Account & Security > Identity Verification**
2. Select your country and verification level (Basic or Advanced)
3. Upload required documents (government ID, proof of address if needed)
4. Wait for approval (usually 5-30 minutes)

<Warning>Higher verification levels unlock larger withdrawal limits and better features.</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Protect your account with 2FA—this is **strongly recommended** for security.

1. Go to **Account & Security > Two-Factor Authentication**
2. Download **Google Authenticator** or **Authy** on your phone
3. Scan the QR code and enter the 6-digit code
4. **Save your backup key securely**—you'll need it if you lose access to your phone

<Warning>Never share your 2FA backup code with anyone!</Warning>

---

## Step 4: Create Your Bybit API Key

1. In the Bybit dashboard, click your profile icon (top right) and select **API**
2. Click **Create New Key** under **API Management**
3. Choose **System-generated API Keys** (recommended for trading bots)
4. Set the following permissions:
   - ✅ **Read-Write** (for order placement)
   - ✅ **Contract Trading** (for USDT perpetual futures)
   - ❌ **Withdrawal** (disable this for security—bots don't need it)
5. (Optional) Set **IP Restriction** to your server's IP for extra security
6. Click **Submit** and complete 2FA verification

**Copy your API Key and Secret immediately—Bybit only shows the Secret once!**

<Tip>Store your API credentials in a password manager—you'll need them for the bot dashboard.</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Prepare Your Wallet and Navigate to the Bot Dashboard

1. Ensure your wallet has **any amount of PUMPKIN tokens** (SUI, Solana, or BASE)
2. Open a new browser window and go to **[voidx.trade](https://voidx.trade)**
3. Click **Connect Wallet** and choose your wallet type
4. Authorize the connection and sign the message

---

## Step 6: Add Bybit Credentials to the Bot

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Exchanges**
2. Click **Add Exchange** and select Bybit
3. Paste your **API Key** from Step 4
4. Paste your **API Secret** from Step 4
5. Click **Test Connection** then **Save**

<Tip>Double-check your pastes—any typos will prevent the bot from connecting!</Tip>

---

## Step 7: Configure Your Bot Settings

1. Click **Bot Management** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Bot** or **Create Bot**
3. Select Bybit as your exchange
4. Choose a symbol (e.g., DOGEUSDT)
5. Select a preset like **Minimalist Alpha** for beginners
6. Review and customize settings as needed

---

## Step 8: Deposit Funds into Bybit

1. In Bybit, click **Assets > Deposit**
2. Select **USDT** (or another stablecoin like USDC)
3. Choose your preferred network:
   - **Sui Network** (fast, low fees—recommended)
   - **Ethereum (ERC20)**, **Polygon**, **Arbitrum**, etc.
4. Copy the deposit address and send funds from your wallet

<Warning>Always send a small test deposit first (e.g., $10) to verify the address!</Warning>

---

## Step 9: Transfer Funds to USDT Perpetual Account

The bot trades on **USDT Perpetual Futures**, so you need to move funds to that account.

1. Go to **Assets > Transfer**
2. From: **Funding Account** → To: **USDT Perpetual**
3. Asset: **USDT**
4. Amount: Enter the amount you want to trade with
5. Click **Confirm Transfer**

---

## Step 10: Set Leverage and Margin Mode

1. Go to **Derivatives > USDT Perpetual**
2. For each symbol you're trading:
   - Click the **leverage icon** (e.g., `10x`)
   - Set your desired leverage (start with **5x-10x** for safety)
   - Change margin mode to **Cross** (recommended for shared margin)

<Tip>Cross margin shares your balance across all positions, reducing liquidation risk.</Tip>

---

## Step 11: Launch and Monitor Your Bot

1. Return to the bot dashboard at **[voidx.trade](https://voidx.trade)**
2. Click **Start** on your bot configuration
3. Watch orders appear in your Bybit account within seconds
4. Monitor in real-time:
   - **Dashboard**: View P&L, positions, and performance metrics
   - **Trading Console > Bot Logs**: See detailed event logs
5. If you see any **RED errors**, report them in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/pumpkinsui)

### Key Reminders:
- ✅ **Cross margin mode** is recommended for safer position management
