# BloFin Perp MM Quickstart

This guide gets you running the **Perpetual Market Maker** strategy on BloFin - the most advanced strategy for active traders who want to profit from bid-ask spreads.

<Note>
**What is Perp MM?** Instead of just buying dips and selling highs, market makers quote BOTH sides - placing buy orders below price AND sell orders above price. You profit from the spread when both sides fill.
</Note>

## Step 4: Understand Your Preset

The **BloFin v7 Long Short Counterscalp** preset is pre-configured with:

| Setting | Value | What It Means |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **equity_pct** | 5% | Uses 5% of your account per grid cycle |
| **leverage** | 75x | High leverage for capital efficiency |
| **quote_size** | $7 | Each order is $7 |
| **max_position** | $2000 | Won't exceed $2000 per side |
| **time_decay** | 48h/48h | Exits stale positions automatically |
| **xgrid_counter** | Enabled | Scalps opposite direction when stuck |

### What This Bot Does

```
Market price: $1.00

Your bot places:
  BUY  @ $0.9985 (15 bps below) ← Waiting to buy cheap
  SELL @ $1.0015 (15 bps above) ← Waiting to sell high

When BOTH fill:
  Bought at $0.9985
  Sold at $1.0015
  Profit: $0.0030 per unit (30 bps) minus fees
```

### Risk Protection Built-In

- **Loss tiers**: Reduces activity as losses grow (1% → 3% → 6% → 10% hard stop)
- **Time decay**: Forces exit after 24h if position stuck
- **Counter-scalp**: When main position underwater, opens opposite side to offset losses

  <Step title="Review Configuration">
    Check the settings look correct
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Start">
    Hit the **Start Bot** button

  <Step title="Confirm">

## Step 6: Monitor Your Bot

### What to Watch

<Check>**Status: Running** (green) - Bot is active</Check>
<Check>**Orders appearing** - You should see bid/ask orders within seconds</Check>
<Check>**No red errors** - Check Trading Console for issues</Check>

### Understanding the Display

```
Position: LONG 150 ASTER @ $1.0234
uPnL: -$2.45 (-0.8%)
Orders: 4 BUY / 4 SELL

SPACING: base=15bps × reactive=1.2x → final=18bps
```

- **Position**: Your current holdings
- **uPnL**: Unrealized profit/loss
- **Orders**: Active quotes on each side
- **SPACING**: How far orders are from mid-price (wider = safer but fewer fills)

---

## First Hour Expectations

**Normal behavior:**
- Multiple order placements and cancellations
- Small positions opening and closing
- P&L fluctuating between small gains and losses

**Warning signs:**
- No orders appearing after 1 minute
- Constant red errors in logs
- Position growing without any take-profits

---

## Adjusting Settings

### Quick Settings (Scaling Agent)

Use the Trading Console to adjust on-the-fly:

```
/set equity_pct 3      # Reduce to 3% for smaller positions
/set equity_pct 7      # Increase to 7% for larger positions
```

### Common Adjustments

| Want to... | Change | From → To |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Reduce risk | `equity_pct` | 5% → 3% |
| More aggressive | `equity_pct` | 5% → 8% |
| Wider spreads | `base_spread_bps` | 15 → 25 |
| Tighter spreads | `base_spread_bps` | 15 → 10 |

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Bot starts but no orders appear">
Check that:
1. You have USDT in the **USDT-M futures** wallet (not Spot)
2. Leverage is set on BloFin for that symbol
3. Symbol format is correct (e.g., `ASTER/USDT:USDT`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Orders keep getting cancelled">
This is often normal - the bot refreshes quotes every 2 seconds. If ALL orders cancel:
1. Check exchange rate limits
2. Reduce `geometric_max_levels` in config
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Position stuck at loss">
The bot has built-in recovery:
1. **Wait** - Time decay will handle it (up to 24h)
2. **Counter-scalp** - XGrid may open opposite position to offset
3. **Check tier** - At 6%+ loss, bot enters defensive mode
</Accordion>
