## Creating API Keys

### Step 1: Access API Management

1. Log in to HTX
2. Click your profile icon (top right)
3. Select **API Management**
4. Click **Create API Key**

### Step 2: Configure Permissions

<Warning>
**Security First**: Only enable the permissions you need.

For VoidX, you need:
- **Read** - Always required
- **Trade** - Required for placing orders
- **DO NOT enable Withdraw** - Never needed, keeps funds secure
</Warning>

Select these permissions:
- [x] Read Info
- [x] Trade
- [ ] Withdraw ← **Leave unchecked!**

### Step 3: Set IP Restrictions (Recommended)

For maximum security, restrict API access to specific IPs:

1. Select **Bind IP addresses**
2. Add your server's IP address
3. This prevents unauthorized access even if keys are leaked

### Step 4: Save Your Credentials

<Note>
You will receive:
- **API Key** (Access Key)
- **Secret Key**

**Save both immediately** - the Secret Key is only shown once!
</Note>

2. Verify available margin after existing positions
3. Reduce position size or close existing trades

### "Order Rejected"

1. Check symbol is correct and tradeable
2. Verify leverage settings match exchange limits
3. Ensure order size meets minimum requirements

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"
