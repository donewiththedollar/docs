# How to Start a New Defx Bot

Welcome to the **Defx Trading Bot Setup Guide**! This step-by-step walkthrough will help you set up your bot for trading on Defx, a decentralized perpetual exchange on Base (Ethereum L2). You'll need a Sui wallet with at least **$100 worth of Pumpkin tokens** ready.

---

## Step 1: Set Up MetaMask for Base Network

Defx operates on **Base**, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer 2 network. You'll need a compatible wallet.

1. Install **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io)** browser extension if you don't have it
2. Create or import your Ethereum wallet
3. **Add Base Network** to MetaMask:
   - Click the network dropdown (top of MetaMask)
   - Click **Add Network** or **Add Network Manually**
   - Enter Base network details:
     - **Network Name**: Base
     - **RPC URL**: `https://mainnet.base.org`
     - **Chain ID**: `8453`
     - **Currency Symbol**: ETH
     - **Block Explorer**: `https://basescan.org`
4. Click **Save**

<Tip>You can also add Base automatically via [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/?search=base) - search "Base" and click Connect Wallet!</Tip>

---

## Step 2: Bridge Funds to Base Network

You'll need ETH on Base for gas fees and USDC for trading.

### Option A: Bridge via Official Base Bridge

1. Go to **[bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)**
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet
3. Bridge **ETH** from Ethereum mainnet (you'll need ~$20-50 for gas fees)
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for the bridge to complete

### Option B: Use Coinbase (Faster & Cheaper)

1. Buy ETH or USDC on **[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)**
2. Withdraw directly to **Base Network** (select "Base" as the network)
3. Paste your MetaMask wallet address
4. Confirm withdrawal (usually arrives in 1-2 minutes)

<Warning>Always send a small test amount first to verify the address and network!</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Get USDC on Base for Trading

The bot trades with USDC on Base. You can:

1. **Bridge USDC** from Ethereum using [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)
2. **Swap ETH for USDC** on Base using a DEX:
   - Go to **[Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org)** and switch to Base network
   - Swap ETH â†’ USDC
   - Keep some ETH for gas fees (~$10-20 worth)

---

## Step 4: Create Defx Account

1. Go to **[app.defx.com](https://app.defx.com)** (or official Defx URL)
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Select **MetaMask** and authorize the connection
4. Sign the signature request to authenticate

<Tip>Defx is non-custodialâ€”you always maintain control of your funds!</Tip>

---

## Step 5: Deposit USDC into Defx

Before trading on Defx, you need to deposit USDC into their perpetual contract.

1. On the Defx dashboard, click **Deposit** or **Transfer**
2. Select **USDC** as the asset
3. Enter the amount you want to deposit
4. Click **Deposit** and approve the transaction in MetaMask
5. Wait for the transaction to confirm on Base (~2-5 seconds)

---

## Step 6: Prepare Your Sui Wallet (Pumpkin Token Requirement)

1. Ensure your Sui wallet has at least **$100 worth of Pumpkin tokens**
2. Open **[trade.quantumvoid.org](https://trade.quantumvoid.org)** in a new tab
3. Click **Defx Perps** or **Multi Exchange Perps** button
4. Click **Connect Sui Wallet**, then authorize the connection

---

## Step 7: Connect Your Base Wallet to QuantumVoid Bot

Since Defx is a DEX, the bot needs your **wallet private key** or uses **WalletConnect** for non-custodial trading.

<Warning>**Security Note**: Only provide private keys to trusted platforms. The bot needs signing authority to execute trades on your behalf.</Warning>

### Option A: Wallet Private Key (Direct Integration)

1. In MetaMask, click the three dots â†’ **Account Details** â†’ **Export Private Key**
2. Enter your MetaMask password
3. Copy your private key (keep this **extremely secure**)
4. In the QuantumVoid dashboard, click **Add Defx Credentials**
5. Paste your Base wallet **private key**
6. Click **Save Credentials**

### Option B: WalletConnect (If Supported)

1. In the dashboard, click **Connect via WalletConnect**
2. Scan the QR code with your mobile MetaMask
3. Approve the connection

<Tip>Private key method gives the bot full trading authority. WalletConnect requires manual approval for each trade.</Tip>

---

## Step 8: Configure Your Bot Settings

1. Click **Bot Management** in the sidebar
2. Scroll down to **Bot Configurations**
3. Click the **`<>`** (JSON editor) icon to open the config editor
4. Customize your settings:
   - **Symbols**: Choose trading pairs (e.g., `ETH-PERP`, `BTC-PERP`)
   - **Wallet Exposure**: Set your risk per symbol (e.g., `0.1` = 10% of balance)
   - **Strategy**: Select `geometric_long_only` or `vortex_dca`
5. Save your configuration

---

## Step 9: Set Leverage on Defx (Optional)

1. On Defx, navigate to the trading pair you want to trade
2. Click the **leverage slider** (usually 1x-20x available)
3. Set your desired leverage (start with **5x-10x** for safety)
4. Choose **Cross** margin mode (shares margin across all positions)

<Tip>Cross margin reduces liquidation risk by pooling your balance across positions.</Tip>

---

## Step 10: Launch and Monitor Your Bot

1. Return to the QuantumVoid dashboard at **[trade.quantumvoid.org](https://trade.quantumvoid.org)**
2. Click **Start** on your Defx bot configuration
3. Watch transactions appear on Base network (view on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org))
4. Monitor in real-time:
   - **Dashboard**: View P&L, positions, and performance metrics
   - **Trading Console > Bot Logs**: See detailed event logs
5. If you see any **RED errors**, report them in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/pumpkinsui)

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't connect:
- Verify your Base wallet has ETH for gas fees
- Check that you've deposited USDC into Defx contract
- Ensure private key is correct (no extra spaces)

### Transactions failing:
- Confirm you have enough ETH on Base for gas
- Check Defx contract has sufficient USDC deposited
- Verify you haven't hit position limits on Defx

### High gas fees:
- Base is an L2 with very low fees (~$0.01-0.10 per transaction)
- If fees are high, check you're on **Base network** (Chain ID 8453), not Ethereum mainnet

### Deposits not showing:
- Wait 5-10 seconds for Base block confirmation
- Check transaction on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org)
- Verify you approved the USDC spending limit
