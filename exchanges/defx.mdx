# How to Start a New Defx Bot

Welcome to the **Defx Trading Bot Setup Guide**! This step-by-step walkthrough will help you set up your bot for trading on Defx, a decentralized perpetual exchange on Base (Ethereum L2). You'll need a wallet (SUI, Solana, or BASE) with **any amount of PUMPKIN tokens** ready.

---

## Step 1: Set Up MetaMask for Base Network

Defx operates on **Base**, Coinbase's Ethereum Layer 2 network. You'll need a compatible wallet.

1. Install **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io)** browser extension if you don't have it
2. Create or import your Ethereum wallet
3. **Add Base Network** to MetaMask:
   - Click the network dropdown (top of MetaMask)
   - Click **Add Network** or **Add Network Manually**
   - Enter Base network details:
     - **Network Name**: Base
     - **RPC URL**: `https://mainnet.base.org`
     - **Chain ID**: `8453`
     - **Currency Symbol**: ETH
     - **Block Explorer**: `https://basescan.org`
4. Click **Save**

<Tip>You can also add Base automatically via [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/?search=base) - search "Base" and click Connect Wallet!</Tip>

---

## Step 2: Bridge Funds to Base Network

You'll need ETH on Base for gas fees and USDC for trading.

### Option A: Bridge via Official Base Bridge

1. Go to **[bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)**
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet
3. Bridge **ETH** from Ethereum mainnet (you'll need ~$20-50 for gas fees)
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for the bridge to complete

### Option B: Use Coinbase (Faster & Cheaper)

1. Buy ETH or USDC on **[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)**
2. Withdraw directly to **Base Network** (select "Base" as the network)
3. Paste your MetaMask wallet address
4. Confirm withdrawal (usually arrives in 1-2 minutes)

<Warning>Always send a small test amount first to verify the address and network!</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Get USDC on Base for Trading

The bot trades with USDC on Base. You can:

1. **Bridge USDC** from Ethereum using [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)
2. **Swap ETH for USDC** on Base using a DEX:
   - Go to **[Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org)** and switch to Base network
   - Swap ETH → USDC
   - Keep some ETH for gas fees (~$10-20 worth)

---

## Step 5: Deposit USDC into Defx

Before trading on Defx, you need to deposit USDC into their perpetual contract.

1. On the Defx dashboard, click **Deposit** or **Transfer**
2. Select **USDC** as the asset
3. Enter the amount you want to deposit
4. Click **Deposit** and approve the transaction in MetaMask
5. Wait for the transaction to confirm on Base (~2-5 seconds)

---

## Step 6: Prepare Your Wallet (PUMPKIN Token Requirement)

1. Ensure your wallet has **any amount of PUMPKIN tokens** (SUI, Solana, or BASE)
2. Open **[voidx.trade](https://voidx.trade)** in a new tab
3. Click **Connect Wallet** and choose your wallet type
4. Authorize the connection and sign the message

---

## Step 7: Connect Your Base Wallet to VoidX

Since Defx is a DEX, the bot needs your **wallet private key** or uses **WalletConnect** for non-custodial trading.

<Warning>**Security Note**: Only provide private keys to trusted platforms. The bot needs signing authority to execute trades on your behalf.</Warning>

### Option A: Wallet Private Key (Direct Integration)

1. In MetaMask, click the three dots → **Account Details** → **Export Private Key**
2. Enter your MetaMask password
3. Copy your private key (keep this **extremely secure**)
4. In the VoidX dashboard, click **Add Defx Credentials**
5. Paste your Base wallet **private key**
6. Click **Save Credentials**

### Option B: WalletConnect (If Supported)

1. In the dashboard, click **Connect via WalletConnect**
2. Scan the QR code with your mobile MetaMask
3. Approve the connection

<Tip>Private key method gives the bot full trading authority. WalletConnect requires manual approval for each trade.</Tip>

---

## Step 8: Configure Your Bot Settings

1. Click **Bot Management** in the sidebar
2. Click **New Bot** or **Create Bot**
3. Select Defx as your exchange
4. Choose a symbol (e.g., ETH-PERP)
5. Select a preset or customize settings
6. Save your configuration

---

## Step 9: Set Leverage on Defx (Optional)

1. On Defx, navigate to the trading pair you want to trade
2. Click the **leverage slider** (usually 1x-20x available)
3. Set your desired leverage (start with **5x-10x** for safety)
4. Choose **Cross** margin mode (shares margin across all positions)

<Tip>Cross margin reduces liquidation risk by pooling your balance across positions.</Tip>

---

## Step 10: Launch and Monitor Your Bot

1. Return to the VoidX dashboard at **[voidx.trade](https://voidx.trade)**
2. Click **Start** on your Defx bot configuration
3. Watch transactions appear on Base network (view on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org))
4. Monitor in real-time:
   - **Dashboard**: View P&L, positions, and performance metrics
   - **Trading Console > Bot Logs**: See detailed event logs
5. If you see any **RED errors**, report them in the [Telegram group](https://t.me/pumpkinsui)

---

## Congratulations—Your Defx Bot is Live on Base!

Your bot is now trading on Defx! Monitor it closely at first, start with small amounts, and scale up as you gain confidence.

### Key Reminders:
- ✅ **Keep ETH on Base** for gas fees (transactions are cheap, ~$0.01-0.10)
- ✅ **Cross margin mode** is recommended for safer position management
- ✅ **Start small** and increase exposure gradually
- ✅ **Monitor logs** regularly for any errors or warnings
- ✅ **Join Telegram** for community support and updates

**Trading involves risk. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.**

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't connect:
- Verify your Base wallet has ETH for gas fees
- Check that you've deposited USDC into Defx contract
- Ensure private key is correct (no extra spaces)

### Transactions failing:
- Confirm you have enough ETH on Base for gas
- Check Defx contract has sufficient USDC deposited
- Verify you haven't hit position limits on Defx

### High gas fees:
- Base is an L2 with very low fees (~$0.01-0.10 per transaction)
- If fees are high, check you're on **Base network** (Chain ID 8453), not Ethereum mainnet

### Deposits not showing:
- Wait 5-10 seconds for Base block confirmation
- Check transaction on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org)
- Verify you approved the USDC spending limit
