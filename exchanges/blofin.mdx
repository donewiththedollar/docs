# How to Start a New BloFin Bot

Welcome to the **VoidX Trading Bot Guide**! This step-by-step walkthrough will help you set up your bot securely and efficiently. Follow these instructions exactly to avoid issues. You'll need a wallet (SUI, Solana, or BASE) with **any amount of PUMPKIN tokens** ready.

---

## Step 1: Sign Up for BloFin

1. Open your browser and go to **[https://partner.blofin.com/d/quantumvoidlabs](https://partner.blofin.com/d/quantumvoidlabs)**
2. Sign up using the referral code **`quantumvoidlabs`** (it should appear in the dropdown for 5% cash back)
3. Agree to the terms and conditions
4. Verify you're human to complete registration

<Tip>This referral code ensures you get that extra 5% cash back—don't skip it!</Tip>

---

## Step 2: Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Your new account will prompt you immediately about low security. **This is mandatory for safety.**

1. Enable 2FA on all your devices and accounts using Google Authenticator (or similar)
2. **Save your Google Authenticator backup code securely**—you'll need it if you lose access
3. Once saved, click **"I have saved the backup key properly"**

<Warning>2FA protects against unauthorized access. Never share your backup code!</Warning>

## Step 3: Create Your Exchange API Key

1. In the BloFin dashboard, look at the top right next to **Assets**—hover over the figurine icon and select **API**
2. Click **+ Create API Key**
3. In the **Application Name** dropdown, select **"Quantum Void Labs"** as the 3rd party
4. Name your key something memorable (e.g., `qvlbot`)
5. In the **Permissions** section, **checkmark the Trade permission** to allow the bot to trade
6. Enter a simple **passphrase** you'll remember (you'll need it later)
7. Click **Next**
8. Verify with your email and Google Authenticator prompt, then submit

**A popup will show your API Key and Secret Key. Copy these immediately—you'll paste them into the bot dashboard next.**

## Step 4: Prepare Your Wallet and Navigate to the Bot Dashboard

1. Ensure your wallet has **any amount of PUMPKIN tokens** (SUI, Solana, or BASE)
2. Open a new browser window and go to **[voidx.trade](https://voidx.trade)** (keeps things organized)
3. Click **Connect Wallet** and choose your wallet type
4. Connect and sign the authorization message

## Step 5: Add BloFin Credentials to the Bot

2. Click **Add Exchange** and select BloFin
3. Paste your **API Key** and **Secret Key** from Step 3
4. Enter the **passphrase** you created earlier
5. Click **Test Connection** then **Save**

<Tip>Double-check your pastes—no typos here, or the bot won't connect!</Tip>

## Step 6: Configure Your Bot Settings

1. Click **Bot Management**
2. Click **New Bot** or **Create Bot**
3. Select BloFin as your exchange
4. Choose a symbol (e.g., DOGEUSDT)
5. Select a preset like **Minimalist Alpha** for beginners
6. Review and customize settings as needed

---

## Step 7: Deposit Funds into BloFin

1. Back in BloFin, click **Assets > Funding**
2. Choose your deposit asset (recommended: **USDC on the SUI network** for speed and low fees)
3. Deposit your funds and wait for them to arrive

<Warning>Always send a small test amount (e.g., $10) before transferring larger sums.</Warning>

---

## Step 8: Convert Funds to USDT-M (Bot's Trading Account)

1. Once deposited, move your USDC to the **Spot** account
2. Swap it for **USDT** in Spot
3. Transfer the USDT to the **USDT-M** account (this is where the bot trades)

---

## Step 9: Set Leverage on BloFin Futures

1. Go to **BloFin Futures > USDT-M**
2. Change the leverage type to **Cross** (instead of Isolated) for shared margin
3. Set your leverage for each trading symbol (e.g., **10x** is a safe starting point)

---

## Step 10: Launch and Monitor Your Bot

1. Return to the bot dashboard and click **Start** on your bot
2. Watch orders populate in your BloFin account
3. For real-time monitoring:
   - Click **Trading Console > Bot Logs** to view event logs
4. If you see any **RED errors**, report them to the Telegram group for quick fixes

---

## Congratulations—Your Bot is Live!

Monitor it closely at first, and remember: **trading involves risk**. Start small, learn from logs, and reach out in Telegram for support.

### Final Reminder
Follow these steps precisely. If something goes wrong, it's often a small detail like a missed permission or test deposit.

**Happy trading with VoidX!**
