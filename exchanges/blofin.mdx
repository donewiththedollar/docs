# How to Start a New BloFin Bot

Welcome to the **Pumpkin Token Algorithmic Trading Bot Guide**! This step-by-step walkthrough will help you set up your bot securely and efficiently. Follow these instructions exactly to avoid issues. You'll need a Sui wallet with at least **$100 worth of Pumpkin tokens** ready.

---

## Step 1: Sign Up for BloFin

1. Open your browser and go to **[https://partner.blofin.com/d/quantumvoidlabs](https://partner.blofin.com/d/quantumvoidlabs)**
2. Sign up using the referral code **`quantumvoidlabs`** (it should appear in the dropdown for 5% cash back)
3. Agree to the terms and conditions
4. Verify you're human to complete registration

<Tip>This referral code ensures you get that extra 5% cash backâ€”don't skip it!</Tip>

---

## Step 2: Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Your new account will prompt you immediately about low security. **This is mandatory for safety.**

1. Enable 2FA on all your devices and accounts using Google Authenticator (or similar)
2. **Save your Google Authenticator backup code securely**â€”you'll need it if you lose access
3. Once saved, click **"I have saved the backup key properly"**

<Warning>2FA protects against unauthorized access. Never share your backup code!</Warning>

---

## Step 3: Create Your Exchange API Key

1. In the BloFin dashboard, look at the top right next to **Assets**â€”hover over the figurine icon and select **API**
2. Click **+ Create API Key**
3. In the **Application Name** dropdown, select **"Quantum Void Labs"** as the 3rd party
4. Name your key something memorable (e.g., `qvlbot`)
5. In the **Permissions** section, **checkmark the Trade permission** to allow the bot to trade
6. Enter a simple **passphrase** you'll remember (you'll need it later)
7. Click **Next**
8. Verify with your email and Google Authenticator prompt, then submit

**A popup will show your API Key and Secret Key. Copy these immediatelyâ€”you'll paste them into the bot dashboard next.**

## Step 4: Prepare Your Sui Wallet and Navigate to the Bot Dashboard

1. Ensure your Sui wallet has at least **$100 worth of Pumpkin tokens**
2. Open a new browser window and go to **[trade.quantumvoid.org](https://trade.quantumvoid.org)** (keeps things organized)
3. Click **BloFin Perps** or **Multi Exchange Perps** button
4. Click **Connect Sui Wallet**, then connect and sign the authorization

---

## Step 5: Add BloFin Credentials to the Bot

1. Click **Add BloFin Credentials**
2. Paste your **API Key** and **Secret Key** from Step 3
3. Enter the **passphrase** you created earlier
4. Click **Save Credentials**

<Tip>Double-check your pastesâ€”no typos here, or the bot won't connect!</Tip>

---

## Step 6: Configure Your Bot Settings

1. Click **Bot Management**
2. Scroll down to **Bot Configurations**â€”you'll see icons like `<>` (JSON editor), a pencil, and others
3. Click the **`<>`** icon to open a new window with the JSON config
4. Edit and customize your settings here (e.g., symbols, strategiesâ€”refer to bot docs for details)

---

## Step 7: Deposit Funds into BloFin

1. Back in BloFin, click **Assets > Funding**
2. Choose your deposit asset (recommended: **USDC on the SUI network** for speed and low fees)
3. Deposit your funds and wait for them to arrive

<Warning>Always send a small test amount (e.g., $10) before transferring larger sums.</Warning>

---

## Step 8: Convert Funds to USDT-M (Bot's Trading Account)

1. Once deposited, move your USDC to the **Spot** account
2. Swap it for **USDT** in Spot
3. Transfer the USDT to the **USDT-M** account (this is where the bot trades)

---

## Step 9: Set Leverage on BloFin Futures

1. Go to **BloFin Futures > USDT-M**
2. Change the leverage type to **Cross** (instead of Isolated) for shared margin
3. Set your leverage for each trading symbol (e.g., **10x** is a safe starting point)

---

## Step 10: Launch and Monitor Your Bot

1. Return to the bot dashboard and click **Start** on your bot
2. Watch orders populate in your BloFin account
3. For real-time monitoring:
   - Click **Trading Console > Bot Logs** to view event logs
4. If you see any **RED errors**, report them to the Telegram group for quick fixes

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulationsâ€”Your Bot is Live!

Monitor it closely at first, and remember: **trading involves risk**. Start small, learn from logs, and reach out in TG for support.

### Final Reminder
Follow these steps precisely. If something goes wrong, it's often a small detail like a missed permission or test deposit.

**Happy trading with Pumpkin! ðŸŽƒ**
