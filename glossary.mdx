# Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of trading terms and Quant Dash-specific concepts.

---

## A

### ATR (Average True Range)
A volatility indicator measuring the average range of price movement over a period. Used to set dynamic stop losses and position sizing.

### Auto-Hedging
Automatic opening of an opposing position when your main position exceeds a loss threshold. Protects against further losses while waiting for recovery.

### Ask
The lowest price at which someone is willing to sell. Also called the "offer" price.

---

## B

### Basis Points (bps)
One basis point = 0.01%. Used to express small percentages.
- 100 bps = 1%
- 10 bps = 0.1%
- 1 bp = 0.01%

### Bid
The highest price at which someone is willing to buy.

### Breakeven
The price at which your position has zero profit or loss after fees.

---

## C

### Cascade
A rapid series of liquidations causing accelerated price movement. Often triggers a "domino effect" of forced selling/buying.

### Cluster (Grid Cluster)
A group of orders placed at specific price levels in a DCA strategy.

### Counter Position
A position opened opposite to your main position, typically to hedge or scalp during adverse moves.

### Cross Margin
A margin mode where all available balance is used as collateral for positions. Higher risk of total liquidation but more efficient capital use.

---

## D

### DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)
An investment strategy of spreading purchases over time/price levels to reduce the impact of volatility.

### Decay Factor
In geometric sizing, the multiplier applied to each subsequent level. `0.92` means each level is 92% the size of the previous.

### Donchian Channel
A technical indicator showing the highest high and lowest low over a period. Used for breakout detection.

### Drawdown
The decline from a peak to a trough in your portfolio value. Usually expressed as a percentage.

---

## E

### EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
A moving average that gives more weight to recent prices. Faster to react than SMA.

### Entry Price
The average price at which you opened your position.

---

## F

### Funding Rate
A periodic payment between long and short position holders in perpetual futures. Positive rate = longs pay shorts; negative = shorts pay longs.

### Fill
When your order executes and becomes a position. A "partial fill" means only some of your order executed.

---

## G

### Geometric Grid
A grid where spacing between orders increases geometrically (exponentially) as you move away from current price.

### Grid Refresh
The process of canceling existing orders and placing new ones as price moves.

### GTFO (Get The F*** Out)
An exit strategy that aggressively closes positions when conditions turn adverse.

---

## H

Your current position size. "High inventory" means you're heavily positioned.

### Inventory Skew
Adjusting bid/ask prices based on your current position to encourage rebalancing.

### Isolated Margin
A margin mode where only the assigned margin is at risk for each position. Limits loss but may cause earlier liquidation.

---

## L

### Leverage
Multiplier for your position size relative to margin. 10x leverage = control $10,000 with $1,000 margin.

### Liquidation
Forced closure of your position when margin is insufficient. Results in loss of position and possibly additional fees.

### Liquidation Price
The price at which your position will be forcibly closed by the exchange.

### Loss Management Tiers
Progressive risk reduction based on loss depth:
- Tier 1 (100 bps): Widen spreads
- Tier 2 (300 bps): Stop new entries
- Tier 3 (600 bps): Exit priority only

---

## M

### Maker
