# PUMPKIN Token Access

QuantumVoid Trading Dashboard uses **token-gated access** powered by the PUMPKIN token on the Sui blockchain. This ensures only committed users access the platform while protecting early supporters.

## Requirements

To access QuantumVoid, you need **EITHER**:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="USD Value" icon="dollar-sign">
    **$100 USD worth** of PUMPKIN at current price
  </Card>
  <Card title="Token Amount" icon="coins">
    **2.8 million PUMPKIN tokens**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  You only need to meet **whichever requirement is LESS**. This protects early holders from price volatility.
</Info>

## How It Works

### Grandfathered Protection

The requirement calculation uses the **minimum** of two values:

```
Required = MIN(
  $100 รท PUMPKIN_PRICE,  // Tokens needed for $100
  2,800,000              // Grandfathered amount
)
```

### Example Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Normal Price ($0.0000358)">
    - $100 รท $0.0000358 = **2,793,296 tokens**
    - Grandfathered: **2,800,000 tokens**
    - **Requirement: 2.8M tokens** (the lesser amount)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Price Drops ($0.00001)">
    - $100 รท $0.00001 = **10,000,000 tokens**
    - Grandfathered: **2,800,000 tokens**
    - **Requirement: 2.8M tokens** (protects early holders!)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Price Moons ($0.0001)">
    - $100 รท $0.0001 = **1,000,000 tokens**
    - Grandfathered: **2,800,000 tokens**
    - **Requirement: 1M tokens** (cheaper for new users!)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- VIP users
- Testing accounts

<Info>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to keep PUMPKIN in my wallet?">
    Yes. The balance check happens every time you start a bot. If your balance drops below requirements, you'll lose access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use PUMPKIN from multiple wallets?">
    No. Only the connected wallet's balance counts toward the requirement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if PUMPKIN price crashes?">
    The 2.8M token floor protects you. You'll never need more than 2.8M tokens regardless of price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I'm whitelisted?">
    Whitelisted addresses bypass all PUMPKIN checks completely. No tokens needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I check my balance before connecting?">
    Yes! The `/api/bot/pumpkin-balance` endpoint accepts wallet addresses publicly.
